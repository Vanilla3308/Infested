# Infested – Unreal Engine Game Project

## Overview
Infested is a game project developed in Unreal Engine, focused on building and iterating on interconnected gameplay systems such as player mechanics, enemy AI behavior, animations, and overall game flow. This repository represents the technical structure of the project rather than a complete playable build.

## About the Codebase
This project is implemented primarily using Unreal Engine’s Blueprint visual scripting system. As a result, most of the game logic is stored in Blueprint `.uasset` files rather than traditional text-based source code files. These Blueprints function as the core “code” of the project, defining system behavior, state transitions, and interactions.

Because Blueprints are binary assets and are best understood visually within Unreal Engine, the logic of the project is documented through gameplay recordings, screenshots, and diagrams rather than raw source files alone.

## Repository Scope
This repository intentionally contains:
- Project configuration files (`Config/`)
- The Unreal project file (`.uproject`)
- Documentation assets (`Docs/`)
- Structural context needed to understand how the project is organized

It does not contain a full set of game assets or a runnable build.

## Asset Notice
Many assets used in the final game—including environments, visual effects, meshes, animations, and audio—were sourced from third-party or marketplace content packs. These assets are not included in this public repository due to licensing and redistribution restrictions.

Placeholder or missing references may appear if the project is opened without those assets installed. Their absence does not reflect missing gameplay logic.

## How to Review the Project
The best way to understand this project is through:
- Gameplay demonstration videos showing systems in action
- Screenshots of Blueprint graphs and state machines
- Written explanations of system design and iteration choices

This repository is intended to provide access to the project’s structure and development approach rather than to serve as a complete distributable game.

## Notes
This project was developed independently, with an emphasis on learning through experimentation, debugging, and iteration within the constraints of available hardware and resources.
